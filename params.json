It's very flexible and very simple to use, you'll love it! \r\n\r\nIt is primarily used to create Openshift Node JS Applications. You can also use this for other projects as the variable dependencies are just very few and are all in the configuration file.\r\n\r\nIt will automatically read models and controllers. Also features automatic routing for created controllers.\r\n\r\nDirectory Structure:\r\n\r\n    |-- controllers\r\n    |-- models\r\n    |-- views\r\n    |-- public\r\n    |-- lib\r\n\r\nYou can see the README.md's of each directory above for more information.\r\n\r\n### Set-Up\r\n\r\nFor OpenShift apps, after creating your node js + mongodb application, clone the project to your local and go to that directory.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install oils -g\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\noils new HelloWorld\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd HelloWorld\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can just simply Download the zip version of this project and copy-paste it to your node js application.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis sample app is self explanatory. Just browse through the directories and files and you will get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nIt uses Mongoose for ORM. Mongo DB for the database.
