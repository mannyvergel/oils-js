It's very flexible and very simple to use, you'll love it! \r\n\r\nIt is primarily used to create Openshift Node JS Applications. You can also use this for other projects as the variable dependencies are just very few and are all in the configuration file.\r\n\r\nIt will automatically read models and controllers. Also features automatic routing for created controllers.\r\n\r\nDirectory Structure:\r\n\r\n    |-- controllers\r\n    |-- models\r\n    |-- views\r\n    |-- public\r\n    |-- lib\r\n\r\nYou can see the README.md's of each directory above for more information.\r\n\r\n### Set-Up\r\n\r\nFor OpenShift apps, after creating your node js + mongodb application, clone the project to your local and go to that directory.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> npm install oils -g\r\n\r\n> oils new HelloWorld\r\n\r\n> cd HelloWorld\r\n\r\n> npm install\r\n\r\n> node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can just simply Download the zip version of this project and copy-paste it to your node js application.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis sample app is self explanatory. Just browse through the directories and files and you will get the hang of it.\r\n\r\nIt uses Mongoose for ORM. Mongo DB for the database. Swig for templating.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have questions, feel free to drop me an email: manny@mvergel.com\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Manny\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\r\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\r\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\r\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\r\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\nsubject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
